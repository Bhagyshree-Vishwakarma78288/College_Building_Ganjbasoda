# College_Building_Ganjbasoda
Worked on the G+2 college building project in Ganjbasoda, focusing on structural detailing using AutoCAD. Designed beams, columns, slabs, foundations, staircase, and terrace, ensuring safety, stability, and compliance with engineering standards.

 worked on the college building project in Ganjbasoda, focusing primarily on structural detailing while incorporating some architectural elements. This G+2 structure consists of a ground floor, first floor, second floor, and terrace, designed to ensure safety, durability, and efficient space utilization.

Key Contributions:
Structural detailing of beams, columns, slabs, and foundations to ensure strength and stability.
Load calculations and reinforcement planning, following standard engineering practices.
Staircase and terrace design, ensuring accessibility and compliance with safety norms.
Utilized AutoCAD for detailed 2D drawings and layout planning, ensuring precision in execution.
Coordinated with architectural aspects to maintain functional and aesthetic integrity.
This project enhanced my expertise in structural engineering, especially in educational infrastructure development, where functionality, safety, and longevity are key priorities.
